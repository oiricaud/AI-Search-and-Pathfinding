Objective:	This	assignment	will	allow	you	to	practice	some	of	the	basic	search	
methods	used	for	problem	solving	in	artificial	intelligence,	and	to	see	the	benefits	of	
heuristic	search.	You will	experiment	with	a	basic formulation	of	the	general	
pathfinding	problem.	
Pathfinding


Pathfinding	is	a	common	problem	that	artificial	agents	must	solve,	including
mapping	services,	artificial	vehicles, AIs	in	real-time	strategy	games, and	robots	that	
must	navigate	in	the	physical	world.	For	this	assignment	we	will	focus	on	simplified	
pathfinding	problem.	Your	program	will	search	for	the	shortest	path	from	a	starting	
location	to	a	goal	location	on	a	square	grid.	However,	this	grid	will	have	some	
impassable	locations	and	varying	terrain	costs	that	must	be	accounted	for.	

Your	program	should	read	in	a	map	file	that	specifies	the	map	in	the	following	
format.	 The	file	name	should	be	able	to	be	specified	on	the	command	line.	The	first	
line	has	the	dimensions	of	the	map,	the	second	line	has	the	coordinates	of	the	
starting location (row	column),	the	third	line	has	the	coordinates	of	the	goal	
location.	After	that	is	the	specification	of	the	map,	which	consists	of	digits	between	0	
and	5,	separated	by	spaces.	These	numbers	represent	the	movement	cost	for	
moving	to	a	given	space	on	the	grid.	

The	number	0	is	a	special	case	and	is	
considered	impassable	terrain. The	numbers	1-5 are	the	number	of	turns	
required	to	move	to	the	given	square,	with 1	being	the	lowest	cost	and	5 being	the	
highest.	 There	is	no	cost	for	moving	to	the	starting	location. The	following	is	an	
example	of	the	map	format.	

5	7
1	2
4	3
2	4	2	1	4	5 2
0	1	2	3	5	3 1
2	0	4	4	1	2 4
2	5	5 3	2	0	1
4	3	3	2	1	0	1

###### Search	Algorithms

You	will	implement	and	compare	three	of	the	search	algorithms	discussed	in	class	
and	in	the	book:
1) Breadth-first	search
2) Iterative	deepening	search
3) A*	search

For	all	three	algorithms	you	should	implement	repeat-state	checking,	so	that	you	do	
not	revisit	states	you	have	already	expanded.	
For	A*	search	you	should	use	the	Manhattan	distance	as	your	heuristic,	but	
implement	the	algorithm	in	a	general	way	so	that	a	new	heuristic	could	be	used.	
Your	program	should	run	each	search	algorithm	with	a	3 minute	time	cutoff	(i.e.,	
you	should	stop	the	search	with	no	result	after	a	maximum	of	3 minutes	of	runtime).	
For	each	of	the	three	algorithms,	print	out	the	following	information	to	the	console:

1) The	cost	of	the	path	found
2) The	number	of	nodes	expanded
3) The	maximum	number	of	nodes	held	in	memory
4) The	runtime	of	the	algorithm	in	milliseconds
5) The	path	as	a	sequence	of	coordinates	(row,	col),	(row	col),	…	,	(row,	col)

If	the	algorithm	terminates	without	finding	a	result,	print	-1	for	the	path	cost and	
NULL	for	the	path	sequence.	You	should	still	print	the	number	of	nodes	and	the	
runtime.	
What	to	Turn	In
You	must	implement	your	program	in	Java,	and	turn	in	both	the	source	code	and	a	
jar	file	that	can	be	run	on	the	command	line	with	the	name	of	the	map	file	and	the	
solution	algorithm	(BFS,	IDS,	AS)	specified	on	the	command	line.		For	example,	I	
should	be	able	to	run	your	program	using	something	similar	to:
java	–jar	myProgram.jar	map1.txt	IDS		
The	code	should	be	clean	and	well	documented.	 You	should	also	include	a	brief	
readme	file	with	instructions	on	how	to	run	your	code.	
Next,	turn	in	the	results	for	3	test	cases	that	you	design	with	increasing	sizes	(e.g.,	
5x5,	10x10,	and	20x20).		These	three	test	cases	should	illustrate	the	differences	in	
scalability	between	the	different	algorithms.	Your	code	will	also	be	tested	on	
some	(unknown)	test	cases,	so	be	sure	to	test	your	code	carefully.
Some	General	Tips	on	How	to	Proceed
Write	a	method	to	read	in/print	out	map	file	to	a	2d	array;	store	source/goal	nodes
Write	a	node	class	(stores	coordinates	and	all	necessary	helper	data;	use	the	same	
node	class	for	all	three	searches)
Write	a	method	to	generate	successor	nodes	(this	should	be	the	same	for	all	three	
searches!)	
Write	BFS;	follow	the	pseudocode	as	closely	as	possible.		
*	Add	a	“closed”	list	to	check	for	repeated	states
*	Test	this	first!	
Write	a	depth-limited	search	method
*	Base	methods	should	look	similar	to	BFS
*	Write	the	IDS	wrapper	that	gradually	increases	search	depth
Write	A*	search
*	write	method	to	compute	manhattan	distance	heuristic
*	write	a	simple	comparator	class,	or	implement	a	compareTo	method	in	your	Node	
class	to	allow	you	to	use	a	PriorityQueue	(builtin	java	class)	to	maintain	a	sorted	list	
of	nodes
*	Implement	the	IDS	method	(follow	psuedocode)
Add	any	necessary	logic	to	run	different	algorithms	based	on	command	line	
parameters,	record	the	necessary	information	about	runtimes,	nodes	created,	etc.	
Add	in	logic	for	cutoff;	this	can	be	as	simple	as	passing	each	search	method	a	
deadline	and	including	an	if	statement	to	terminate	the	search	within	the	main	loop	
of	the	algorithm	if	the	time	exceeds	the	deadline
Create	and	run	several	test	cases	on	different	maps;	document	results	and	write	up	
your	findings
Generate	a	jar	file,	and	TEST	YOUR	JAR	FILE	TO	MAKE	SURE	IT	WORKS!	
Make	sure	your	submission	includes	ALL	of	the	following:
*	working	JAR	file
*	source	code
*	test	cases	(i.e.,	map	files	you	used	for	testing)
*	a	writeup/discussion	of	your	results
